While international discourse on collectivity often focuses on aesthetics and conceptual frameworks, the organizational infrastructures that sustain collective practices remain largely underexplored. Our research aims to shift this focus by identifying recurring patterns and shared structural elements in contemporary collective work.<br/><br/>The research team, comprising Bahman Iranpour, Julian Kraemer, Lilli Kim Schreiber, and Mariem Bettouhami, brings interdisciplinary expertise in cultural theory, art practices, and governance models. Bahman Iranpour, a PhD candidate at Zeppelin University, focuses on socially engaged art and independent artistic practices in contemporary Iran. Julian Kraemer, an artist and cultural scientist with a Master's degree in Arts, Media &amp; Creative Industries from Zeppelin University, explores collective engagement as an own form of democratic appropriation. Lilli Kim Schreiber, an advanced BA student in cultural management at Zeppelin University, specializes in the sociology of the arts and international intermediary organizations from a cultural policy perspective. Mariem Bettouhami, a classical singer and music teacher with both a bachelor's and master's degree from the Institut Supérieur de Musique de Tunis, brings expertise in opera and performance arts to the team.</div></div></div><div id="i0y4nj" class="gjs-grid-row"><div class="gjs-grid-column"><div id="itndw-3-2-2-6-3-4-2" class="text-main-content"><div><strong data-start="0" data-end="19">Bahman Iranpour</strong> is a filmmaker and PhD researcher at Zeppelin University, studying socially engaged art in Iran.

Together, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 15 collectives in Tunis and Cairo, selecting nine for in-depth analysis. By prioritizing self-description over external evaluation, we sought to gain a deeper understanding of how collectives define and organize their work, often through fluid, non-hierarchical structures.<br/><br/>Our research reveals several key insights. First, collective care practices, often overlooked, are integral to sustaining collective work and should be recognized as strategic methodologies. Second, collectives excel at distributing and sustaining resources, with their perceived inefficiency often serving as a strength through diverse decision-making processes. Finally, the study underscores the need for a new, more nuanced glossary to better capture the complexities of collective terminologies, which remain largely unrecognized in institutional policy frameworks.<br/>These findings are disseminated through two main outputs. The first is a research article, which delves into the theoretical and practical aspects of collective infrastructures and provides recommendations for supporting such practices in the cultural sector. The second output is collectivize.org, a digital platform designed as an open-access resource for artist collectives worldwide. This platform fosters dialogue, collaboration, and knowledge exchange, offering a space to share experiences, resources, and strategies. By doing so, it aims to support sustainable collective practices and strengthen the global commons in the arts.</div></div></div></div><div id="iz29ek-3-2-5-2-2" class="gjs-grid-row"><div id="ik2rdi-3-2-6-2-2" class="gjs-grid-column"><h1 id="io18xhl-2-6-2-2">Get in touch with us:</h1><a id="iar3s-2-3-3-2-5-2-2" href="mailto:collectivise@proton.me?subject=collectivise.org" class="gjs-button">e-Mail</a></div></div><div id="iv3be5-4" class="gjs-grid-row"><div id="ilriti-4" class="gjs-grid-column"><div id="im0rle-4" class="gjs-grid-row"><div id="iotp6j-4" class="gjs-grid-column"><a href="https://collectivise.org/" id="iih6cv-4" class="gjs-link-box"><img id="i7yx68-4" src="assets/collectivise_org.jpg"/></a></div></div><div id="it6g1v-5" class="gjs-text-blue">Copyright © 2025 collectivise.org</div><a id="i6g6tq-3" href="./impressum.html" class="gjs-link-box"><div id="it6g1v-4-3" class="gjs-text-blue">Impressum</div></a></div></div></body>
